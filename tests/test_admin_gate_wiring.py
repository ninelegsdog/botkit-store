"""The admin password check must be rate-limited and timing-safe.

Before this change `check_password` compared `message.text == config.admin_password` with
no attempt limit, so the admin surface had unlimited password guesses and the comparison
was timing-observable. `AdminGate` was imported by the module's tests but never wired into
the router. These tests pin the behaviour that is actually reachable from Telegram.
